## Premise

These projects are only examples I made these examples while studying Rust and even if I covered most of the language main features, they should not be taken as your rust manual, but just only a short and quick reference.
If you want to learn Rust, I suggest the official Book <https://github.com/rust-lang/book>

## Projects

All the projects are created and managed with cargo and can be run using ```cargo run```.

### Hello Rust

Just a program which prints on stdout "Hello, Rust!".

### Datatypes

This projects introduces how variables are declared in Rust and its scalar and compound datatypes.

### Control Flow

This projects shows the control flows of Rust and how to define a function (also how to read from stdin).

### Ownership

This projects shows the ownership paradigm of Rust.

### Structs

This projects shows how Structs and Enums work in Rust.

### My First Module

An example of how to create a module in Rust, in this example I will create a utils module made up of two submodules: strutils and sysutils.
This examples shows then, how to invoke the module from the main application.

### Collections

An example which shows the most important common collection types. (Vector, String, Hash Maps)

### Errors

An example which shows how to handle errors in Rust.

### Generics

An example which shows an overview of generics, traits and lifetime

### Tests

An example which illustrates how to write tests in Rust.
